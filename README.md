Warning: You need Pterodactyl already set up on a domain for Heliactyl to work

1. Upload the file above onto a Pterodactyl NodeJS server [Download the egg from Parkervcp's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/bots/discord/discord.js)
2. Unarchive the file and set the server to use NodeJS 17
3. Configure webserver.json to use the server's port
4. Start the server and open the server's IP in your browser and configure the dashboard settings
5. Login to your DNS manager, point the domain you want your dashboard to be hosted on to your VPS IP address. (Example: dashboard.domain.com 192.168.0.1)
6. Run `apt install nginx && apt install certbot` on the vps
7. Run `ufw allow 80` and `ufw allow 443` on the vps
8. Run `certbot certonly -d <Your Heliactyl Domain>` then do 1 and put your email
